				<p><em>Open to opportunities...</em></p>
				<p align="justify">I was born in the year 2001. I'm an excellent communicator and listener, with a knack for figuring out how to approach a problem from different angles. I thrive in fast-paced environments, and I can bring order to chaos. I'm able to make decisions and act on them immediately even if I'm not 100% sure what my next step will be, I know that it's important to show confidence in front of my coworkers. I’m a very friendly person who loves to meet new people and make new friends. I’m always willing to help other people with any task or project. I am always looking for new opportunities for myself to progress and see how far I can go.</p>
